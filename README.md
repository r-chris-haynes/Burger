# Eat Da Burger
**Overview**
Eat-Da-Burger was made with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern.  Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars generates the HTML.
**How it Works**
Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app dispalys the burger under the Order Up heading.

Each burger in the waiting area has a Devour! button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the Devoured section. The app stores every burger in a MYSQL database, whether devoured or not.
