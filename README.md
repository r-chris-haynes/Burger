# Burger
Eat-Da-Burger was made with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern.  Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars generates the HTML.

Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app dispalys the burger on the top  of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the bottom  of the page.

The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
